					<h3>From Struggless to Success</h3>
					<p>I can't stop dreaming at the Capital of the World: The brightest days will come ...I may be late in my dream...Oh yes, but better to be late than never. As a survivor of so many attacks, aggresive behaviors, and hurricane Sandy,I am here to happily surprise all. To show the courage of overcoming fear for success. LIFE LEADS ALL HUMAN BEINGS TO HARDSHIPS, WE ARE ALL IMPACTED. Studying with love, and sacrifice I hope to be counted as a New Yorker, too. I have the determined that opportunities are created...all I need is your advice and experience. I believe that the future is in my hands. I am sure, that after failure, frustrations and chaos my success will come and that it will be a defining and wonderful process for exemplary achievement. My willigness and courage is to be remember as a "heroically overcome hero in New York City, I believe that working united in harmony, we will achieve great things!."</p><img alt="responsive image" class="img-fluid" src="img/img-9986.png"></div>

					<h3>Life is Precious</h3>
					<p>As we all have the same needs and good intentions, lets never forget that karma can be our best allies. let's try to accept others, without judgment we are all sinner,as God's kindness. So many did amazing sacrifices for us to preserve our quiet and peaceful nights, allow all to dream, relax and plan how to achieve with wisdom and honesty our american dream. The life of others should be also our joy and happines. We are here to safe a better live to our future generations.</p><img alt="responsive image" class="img-fluid" src="img/img-0087.png"> <img alt="responsive image" class="img-fluid" src="img/img-9982.png"> <img alt="responsive image" class="img-fluid" src="img/img-9386.png"></div>

					<p>Is Education the problem?<br>
					Persistence, discipline and a lot of enthusiasm is all we need. I am encharge of my happiness! As we all have the same 24 hours in a day, visit CUNY... there are so many free opportunities there too. We all have the same hours in a day, and the same needs, but if you didn't graduate...Visit BMCC.MEOC 163W 125th 15th floor. Get your closer branch...Stand Up</p>

					<p>Let's stop blaming...I dream to see a happier and healthier world...many people around the world like to live in the place that you are attacking. Avoid constant bitterness and hate. Protect your body and mind. Look for healthy decisions: Exercise keep strong, go out...get the help if you are daily drinking, doing drugs, or smelling dust computer cleaner...instead of sleeping. That is not the best decision. Eliminate complains, the list of disabled people who overcome challenges is extensive: Einstein, Lincoln, Dysney, Seuss, Angelous, etc. Only happiness is my concern. Start accepting others and loving changes. it is healthier to spray love to all. Life is Precious</p>
