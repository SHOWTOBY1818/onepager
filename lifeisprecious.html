				<p>Let's stop blaming...I dream to see a happier and healthier world...many people around the world like to live in the place that you are attacking. Avoid constant bitterness and hate. Protect your body and mind. Look for healthy decisions: Exercise keep strong, go out...get the help if you are daily drinking, doing drugs, or smelling dust computer cleaner...instead of sleeping. That is not the best decision. Eliminate complains, the list of disabled people who overcome challenges is extensive: Einstein, Lincoln, Dysney, Seuss, Angelous, etc. Only happiness is my concern. Start accepting others and loving changes. it is healthier to spray love to all. Life is Precious</p>
