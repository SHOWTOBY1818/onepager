		<h1>From: Struggles <br>To : Success</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my Spa of Success" I wish to leave to my future generations a message of peace, harmony and gratitude for all the beautiful and to the not so pleasent moment lived in this beautiful paradise of the earth. Stand Up...Strech and Learn for FREE. The future is not in others hands, parties, or promises. The future is in our own hands. Let's remove all hate for strenght in education. All we need is some discipline and effort. Here for me, is one of the many solutions, education is available to us. It exist at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building. I would like to extend my gratitud and sincere appreciation to you: All the administration, Mr. Adam Cruz, Mr. Bruce Lincoln and Teacher Ms Judi Desire for your call and tireless enthusiasm to serve ALL people with respect and simplicity. "Happiness is to transpass all fears visualizing all way long that life is precious!" We all should start the day with the "YES, I CAN". Thanks MEOC here every day begins with hopes and dreams offering plenty of opportunities. It is beautiful how every one try to UNIFY AND PRESERVE THE BEAUTIFUL OF NEW YORK CITY. Let's be grateful as not everyone around the world have this privileges. Make sure that daily you will treat yourself with love and respect to you and all others. One clicK! is all you need...Stand Up strong...Stretch and learn for free. The future is not in others hands, parties or promises. The future is in our own hands, let's remove all hate for strengh in education.</p>New York City as in life, all roads are done, let me say: "it doesnt matter what you try.."It is no shortcut to The Bronx". Clearly, life have been resistant...alone in the world. No one recently scaped from tears. I am still tangled ...plagued by delays and frauds. It hasn't been easy for anyone. Vampires are well known as predictors, day by day as time runs. You may feel overwhelmed and that you are unable to accomplish all the things your dream of. My alternative: Faith! Gratitud everyday for what I have and for all of you. I CAN'T STOP DREAMING OF THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD: The brightest days will come... being late in my dreams...oh YES. Maybe it is telling me that it is better to be late than never. As a survivor of the Sandy Huracan. I am here to advocate for help. UNITED IN HARMONY, We will rebuild NYC. Lets us STAND taller from our disasters and chaos. Let me try to invite HERE, our exemplary guesses of our society and authorities! We need their support...
