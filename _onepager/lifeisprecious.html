				<p> Life is too short. I dream to see a happier and healthier world...many people around the world pay very expensive price to live in the place that we are attacking. Let's try to void constant bitterness and hate. Let's protect our body and mind. Let's work harder for healthier decisions: Exercise keep strong, go out dance, travel o just enjoy the nature...get the help that is required if you are daily drinking, doing drugs, or smelling dust computer cleaner...instead of sleeping. That is not the best decision. Eliminate complains, the list of disabled people who overcome challenges is extensive: Einstein, Lincoln, Dysney, Seuss, Angelous, etc. Only happiness is my concern. Start accepting others and loving changes. it is healthier to spray love to all. Life is Precious</p>
